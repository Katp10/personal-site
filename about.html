        3 glorious, beautiful girls. Whenever I need some motivation I always think of them. For them I strive to be a better person each and every day.
        Also I have a wonderful fianc√®, Moh. We've been together 4 long, excruciating years.&#128514 Just kidding, he's awesome.&#128525 <br><br>
        I started to work on web pages about 2 years ago. I was sitting home with my now 2 year old daughter
        and I decided that I wanted to make a change and I've always been facinated by people who knew how to code. Previously I was a mail carrier and coding is certainly alot better to me than
        sweating profusely in the Florida sun.<br><br> Little by little I've learned HTML, and then CSS, and now begining to work with Javascript. Also I've created a few pages using the Wordpress and Builderall platforms. Tools I've used so far include Sublime Text, VS Code, and Atom IDE's. And I have to include I've played around a little with Android Studio. Making apps is surely something I'd like to explore further in the future. This field is ever changing and evolving which will keep me constantly learning.</div></div>
